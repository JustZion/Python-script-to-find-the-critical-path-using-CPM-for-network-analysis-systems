HOW TO USE

1. You are expected to input the number of activities you would be considering
2. It is advisable to make the activity names in lowercase characters

3. The program accepts comma seperated input e.g (a,b,c).
4. From the above illustration;
	a represents the activity.
	b represents the predecessor.
	c represents the duration of the activity.
5. Activities that have no predecessor should have their predecessor's represented by "n".
6. Usually, the first activity has not predecessor, so its predecessor should be represented by "n" e.g (a,n,3)
	where a represents the activity name
	where n represents the fact that there is no predecessor
	where 3 represents the duration of the activity
7. The program analyses the data, and shows the following details
	a. Activity names
	b. Earliest start of each activity
	c. Earliest finish of each activity
	d. Latetst start of each activity
	e. Latest finish of each activity
	f. Total float of each activity
	g. Free float of each activity
	i. A status id showing whether the activity falls under "CRITICAL" or "NON-CRITICAL"
	h. Shows the Critical path of the activities
	g. Shows the duration of the critical path 
	i. Finally, Plots a gantt chart automatically showing an illustration of the critical, non-critical activities and critical path
8. From the graph, the critica path can be identified by its unique color.
